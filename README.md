# Job Automation Risk Analyser

This project analyses job automation risks due to artificial intelligence, providing insights into which occupations are most susceptible to automation and recommending reskilling pathways.

## Features

- **Random Forest Classification**: Predicts automation risk for different occupations
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups jobs with similar risk profiles
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends reskilling pathways
- **Visualisation**: Analyses risks by sector and job characteristics
